    Process a dictionary of SNP-gene tests to calculate the effective Bonferroni correction number.
    
    This function calculates the genotype correlation matrix for the SNPs tested for each gene using windows around the gene.
    It uses the Ledoit-Wolf estimator to calculate a regularized correlation matrix, finds the eigenvalues of this matrix,
    and determines how many eigenvalues are needed to reach the variance threshold. This final value is the effective Bonferroni correction number.
    The function outputs the corrected p-value for the best SNP per gene to a file.

    Parameters:
    test_dict (dict): Dictionary with gene IDs as keys and test results as values.
    gen_dict (dict): Dictionary with SNP positions as keys and genotypes as values.
    phepos_dict (dict): Dictionary with phenotype IDs as keys and their start positions as values.
    OUT_fh (str or file-like object): File handle or path to the output file.
    input_header (str): Header line for the output file.
    var_thresh (float): Variance threshold for determining the effective number of tests.
